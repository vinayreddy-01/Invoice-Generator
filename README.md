### How to run this demo
The demo has been deployed using Python 3.7. **We suggest creating a new virtual environment**, then running:

git clone https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-invoice-generator.git
cd example-app-invoice-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### About the app

- Code is powered by <a href="https://streamlit.io"> Streamlit</a> üéà and deployed on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) ‚òÅÔ∏è
- It is super compact: only 50 lines of code. Check it out in [`streamlit_app.py`](https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-invoice-generator/blob/main/streamlit_app.py)

### About the template
   
- Template must be an HTML file with <code>{{ my_variable }}</code> variable placeholders as supported by [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/). 
- Our example template here is [`invoice_template.html`](https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-invoice-generator/blob/main/invoice_template.html) and you can see placeholders e.g. [here](https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-invoice-generator/blob/main/invoice_template.html#L329).
   
ü™Ñ Tip: if you're not an HTML expert (or if you're lazy, or both) just kick-off your template using Google Docs at <a href="https://docs.new">docs.new</a> and then export it as HTML using <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Download</kbd> > <kbd>Web page (.html, zipped)</kbd>. For example, this is our original <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekg49TXzQfolnEw-czBo7pDVmOTyAkr6EsKs-_h-kq0/edit"> template in Google Docs!
